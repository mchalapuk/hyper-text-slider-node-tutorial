# 0. Introduction

This is a tutorial on using [hermes][hermes] via [node][node] and [browserify][browserify].
Source code examples used in here make up a complete project of&nbsp;a&nbsp;single webpage
containing a nice slideshow. All examples were extracted from the tutorial to provide
executable form of&nbsp;the project (check out [1. Project Setup][setup] for details).

## 0.1. Prerequisites

Following tools will be used throughout the project:

 * [bash][bash] as system shell,
 * [npm][npm] for dependency management,
 * [gulp][gulp] as a build system,
 * [browserify][browserify] to make [node][node] modules work in the browser,
 * [sass][sass] as a preprocessor for [css][css],
