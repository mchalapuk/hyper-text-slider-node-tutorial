# 0. Introduction

This is a tutorial on using [hermes][hermes] via [node][node] and [browserify][browserify].
Source code examples used in here make up a complete project of a single webpage containing
a nice slideshow. All examples were extracted from the tutorial to provide executable form
of the project (check out [Directory Structure][dir-structure] for details).

Following tools will be used throughout the project:

 * [bash][bash] as system shell,
 * [npm][npm] for dependency management,
 * [gulp][gulp] as a build system,
 * [browserify][browserify] to make [node][node] modules work in the browser,
 * [sass][sass] as a preprocessor for [css][css],
 * [hermes][hermes] to implement a slideshow on a webpage.
